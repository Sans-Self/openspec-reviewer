# lineage Specification

## Purpose

Define the one identity mechanism every Opake supersede chain shares: **lineage**, the AT-URI of the chain's genesis record, carried on every record after genesis. A chain of supersedes is one object over time — a workspace whose keyring rotates, a document that is edited, a directory that is reorganized — and lineage is the stable name of that object, derivable from any record in the chain without walking back to genesis.

The mechanism was born in the keyring chain, where the genesis URI already served as the workspace identity (`spec:workspace-identity`). This spec generalizes it: documents and directories carry lineage with the same field shape, the same anchor rule, and the same never-flips enforcement. Where cryptography needs a chain-constant scoping value — the AAD on every metadata and content ciphertext (`spec:document-crypto § Ciphertexts are AAD-bound to their lineage anchor and type`) — the lineage anchor is that value: it lets a ciphertext travel verbatim across supersedes while staying bound to the object it belongs to.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Lineage is the chain's genesis URI, carried on every supersede

Every chained record kind — keyring, document, directory — SHALL carry a `lineage` field on every record after genesis, set to the AT-URI of the chain's genesis record. The genesis record SHALL NOT carry the field: it identifies itself. Any holder of a chain record SHALL derive the object's stable identity through the anchor rule:

```
lineage_anchor(record) = record.lineage.unwrap_or(record's own URI)
```

The anchor is constant across the whole chain — every record, genesis or descendant, resolves to the same value. This generalizes the mechanism the keyring already uses (`Keyring::lineage_anchor`, crates/opake-core/src/records/keyring.rs; identity semantics in `spec:workspace-identity § Genesis URI is the workspace identity`): for a keyring, the lineage *is* the workspace identity. Documents and directories carry lineage with the same shape and the same rule.

Record kinds that never supersede — cabinet directories and cabinet documents (`spec:tree-cabinet § Cabinet curatorial writes mutate directory records in place`) — SHALL NOT carry the field: every such record is permanently its own genesis, the anchor rule resolves to its own URI, and a declared `lineage` on one would be dead weight the never-flips machinery never validates.

Lineage is a carried declaration, not an attested fact — the same trust class as every self-declared chain field. What makes it load-bearing is the never-flips enforcement below plus, where cryptography consumes it, the property that a lying writer only breaks its own record's decryptability (`spec:document-crypto § Ciphertexts are AAD-bound to their lineage anchor and type`).

#### Scenario: anchor derived from an arbitrary chain record

- **GIVEN** any record in a supersede chain — genesis, superseded intermediate, or head
- **WHEN** a component derives the object's identity from it
- **THEN** the result is `lineage.unwrap_or(own URI)` and equals the genesis URI

#### Scenario: genesis identifies itself

- **GIVEN** a freshly created record with no `supersedes` and no `lineage`
- **WHEN** its anchor is derived
- **THEN** the anchor is the record's own URI, and every later record in the chain declares that URI as its lineage

### Requirement: Lineage never flips across a supersede

A superseding record's declared `lineage` SHALL equal its predecessor's lineage anchor. The indexer SHALL reject a supersede whose lineage does not match at write time, alongside its existing chain-authority checks. Clients SHALL mirror the check when walking chains (crates/opake-core/src/directories/chain.rs — `verify_and_walk_chain` serves both directory and keyring chains) and treat a flipped-lineage record as outside the chain, per the read-lenient posture of `spec:record-validity § corrupt records are skipped per-record, never wholesale`.

A record that declares `lineage` without `supersedes` claims chain membership without linking into a chain, and SHALL receive the same disposition as a flipped lineage: outside any chain, skipped per-record in listing surfaces with the existing degradation signals, and not resolvable as chained state. This mirrors the indexer's write-time rejection of the naked-supersede shape without introducing a new failure class.

#### Scenario: indexer rejects a flipped lineage

- **GIVEN** a chain whose anchor is genesis URI G
- **WHEN** a member writes a superseding record declaring `lineage` ≠ G
- **THEN** the indexer rejects the write, and the chain head does not advance

#### Scenario: client walk skips a flipped lineage

- **GIVEN** a snapshot containing a record whose `lineage` disagrees with its predecessor's anchor
- **WHEN** a client selects chain heads
- **THEN** the mismatched record is not treated as part of the chain, and the prior head remains canonical

#### Scenario: naked lineage is outside any chain

- **GIVEN** a record declaring `lineage` with no `supersedes`
- **WHEN** a client encounters it in a snapshot or on a resolution path
- **THEN** it is treated as outside any chain — skipped with the existing per-record degradation signals, never adopted as chained state

### Requirement: Records that seal ciphertexts to their own URI choose their own rkey

Any record kind whose genesis seals a ciphertext bound to its own URI — documents, directories, keyrings — SHALL be created with a client-chosen rkey known before encryption: a client-generated TID, a fixed convention like the cabinet root's `self` rkey (`spec:tree-cabinet § The cabinet tree has a fixed root on the owner's PDS`), or a derived tag like the keyring genesis rkey, which is computed from the genesis group key and owner DID before the record exists (`spec:workspace-identity § Genesis URI is the workspace identity`). Letting the PDS assign the rkey makes the genesis AAD uncomputable at encrypt time and is therefore not permitted for these kinds.

PDS-assigned rkeys remain acceptable only where no ciphertext binds the record's own URI: the pending-share record binds the *target document's* anchor (`spec:document-crypto § Ciphertexts are AAD-bound to their lineage anchor and type`), so its own address may be assigned late.

Client-generated rkeys also make creation retries idempotent: a retried `createRecord` at the same rkey either succeeds or reports the record exists, instead of minting a duplicate.

#### Scenario: directory creation knows its URI before encrypting

- **GIVEN** a new directory being created
- **WHEN** its metadata is encrypted
- **THEN** the record's TID was generated client-side first, the AAD binds the resulting URI, and the subsequent `createRecord` uses that TID as the rkey

#### Scenario: keyring genesis knows its URI before encrypting

- **GIVEN** a new workspace being created
- **WHEN** the genesis keyring's metadata and member wraps are built
- **THEN** the rkey was derived from the genesis group key and owner DID first, every URI-bound value binds the resulting genesis URI, and the subsequent `createRecord` uses the derived tag as the rkey

### Requirement: Supersede references carry a content pin

Every superseding record SHALL carry, alongside `supersedes`, the CID of the exact predecessor record it supersedes (`supersedesCid`), stamped by the writer from the chain-head pointer it holds. The pin names the immediate predecessor and SHALL NOT be copied through verbatim-copy paths — each record in a cascade or advance pins its own predecessor.

Readers SHALL compare a fetched predecessor's reported CID against the pin when present. A disagreement classifies the link as unverifiable; the consequence follows the owning chain's existing posture — degradation to the newest fully-verifiable head on directory chains (`spec:tree-chains § Consumers build the live tree from chain heads only`), non-acceptance of the proposed head on authority walks.

**What the pin does and does not guarantee (v1).** The reader compares the pin against the CID the serving host *reports* for the predecessor, not against a hash recomputed from the fetched bytes — clients do not compute atproto CIDs today. So the pin detects CID disagreement between honest, non-colluding hosts (an out-of-date cache, an accidental substitution, an indexer/PDS reporting mismatched heads); it does NOT detect a malicious host that serves tampered bytes while reporting the true CID, because that host controls both. True byte-level tamper-evidence requires recomputing the CID from the fetched bytes and is deferred to the work that needs it — replicated and archival chain serving, where records arrive from untrusted third parties (`spec:lineage` is the field's home; the byte-binding is tracked as replication-tier follow-up). Critically, this limitation does not touch workspace identity: identity adoption is guarded by key derivation (`spec:workspace-identity § Identity adoption verifies by derivation`), never by pins. The pin is defense-in-depth against honest-host inconsistency and a pre-v1 wire reservation so the field exists before the freeze; it is not, at v1, a trust boundary against a hostile host.

#### Scenario: disagreeing predecessor CID is rejected

- **GIVEN** a superseding record pinning its predecessor's CID
- **WHEN** a walk fetches a predecessor whose reported CID differs from the pin
- **THEN** the link is classified unverifiable

#### Scenario: a hostile host reporting a matching CID is not caught at v1

- **GIVEN** a host that serves tampered predecessor bytes while reporting the pinned CID
- **WHEN** a walk fetches it
- **THEN** the pin comparison passes — this is a known v1 limitation, closed only by recomputing the CID from bytes (deferred replication-tier work)

#### Scenario: cascade pins per level

- **GIVEN** a directory cascade superseding records at multiple levels
- **WHEN** each superseding record is built
- **THEN** each pins the CID of its own immediate predecessor, not a pin inherited from elsewhere in the cascade
