## Purpose

The words this project uses, one requirement per term. The requirement
name is the term, the body its meaning, the scenarios show it in a
sentence, and a `- **Deprecated:**` line lists the words not to use for
it. The reviewer reads this file as the glossary: it finds defined terms
and their synonyms anywhere in prose, and proposes new terms only from
what specs already mark with backticks or double quotes.

## Requirements

### Requirement: canon

The specs under `openspec/specs/`, as they are in the working directory.
Every review compares a change against canon.

- **Deprecated:** main specs, baseline

#### Scenario: In a sentence

- **WHEN** a delta modifies a requirement
- **THEN** the review pairs it with the same requirement in canon

### Requirement: snapshot

The files under `openspec/` a source yields, each with a before and an
after side. Every source produces one; everything downstream reads only
the snapshot and canon.

- **Deprecated:** patch set, changeset

#### Scenario: In a sentence

- **WHEN** the `gh` source fetches a pull request
- **THEN** it returns a snapshot of the files the pull request touches

### Requirement: source

Where a change comes from: the working tree, a unified diff, two git
refs or a pull request. A source yields a snapshot.

- **Deprecated:** provider, adapter

#### Scenario: In a sentence

- **WHEN** the user runs `openspec-reviewer diff pr.patch`
- **THEN** the diff source reads the patch

### Requirement: pairing

One delta entry matched with its canon counterpart: the requirement
before, the requirement after, their diff, and the findings about them.
A review is a list of pairings grouped by capability.

- **Deprecated:** pair, matching

#### Scenario: In a sentence

- **WHEN** a RENAMED entry names a requirement canon has
- **THEN** the pairing shows the old name struck through and the new one added

### Requirement: finding

One thing the review noticed about a pairing, with a fixed severity of
error, warning or note. Errors set the exit status to 2, warnings to 1.

- **Deprecated:** issue, diagnostic, violation

#### Scenario: In a sentence

- **WHEN** a MODIFIED requirement has no canon counterpart
- **THEN** the pairing carries an error finding
